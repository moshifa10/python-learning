ðŸŽ¯ Challenge 13: The Guess Analyzer
ðŸ§© Story
    1. Imagine a simple number-guessing game where multiple players guess numbers between 1â€“10.
    2. Youâ€™re given all their guesses, and your job is to analyze who was closest to the secret number.
    Example:
        - guesses is a dictionary of player names and their guesses, e.g.:
        Input:
            {"Alice": 5, "Bob": 9, "Charlie": 3, "Njabulo": 7}
        Output:
            {
            "closest_player": "Njabulo",
            "closest_difference": 1,
            "guesses_above": ["Bob"],
            "guesses_below": ["Alice", "Charlie"],
            "all_differences": {"Alice": 3, "Bob": 1, "Charlie": 5, "Njabulo": 1}
            }
