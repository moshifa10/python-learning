ðŸ’¼ Challenge 14: Employee Performance Analyzer
ðŸ§  Scenario 
    1. Youâ€™re given a list of employee records.
    2. Each record is a dictionary containing:
        - "name" â€” employee name
        - "department" â€” the department they work in
        - "sales" â€” the total sales amount they made
    Your goal: analyze the data and find out whoâ€™s performing best.

    Example:
        Input: 
            employees = [
                {"name": "Alice", "department": "Electronics", "sales": 12000},
                {"name": "Bob", "department": "Clothing", "sales": 8000},
                {"name": "Charlie", "department": "Electronics", "sales": 15000},
                {"name": "Dana", "department": "Clothing", "sales": 7000},
                {"name": "Njabulo", "department": "Home", "sales": 11000}
            ]
        Output:
                {
                "total_sales_per_department": {
                    "Electronics": 27000,
                    "Clothing": 15000,
                    "Home": 11000
                },
                "top_seller": "Charlie",
                "top_seller_sales": 15000,
                "average_sales": 10600.0,
                "department_with_highest_sales": "Electronics"
                }

    ðŸ§© Bonus Challenge (optional)
        Add a new key:
            "ranked_employees": [("Charlie", 15000), ("Alice", 12000), ("Njabulo", 11000), .
