⚔️ Challenge 12: The Mountain Peak Finder
🧠 Problem:
    1. Given a list of integers representing altitudes (like a mountain range), find the peak elements — numbers that are greater than both of their neighbors.
        Then determine:
            - How many peaks exist.
            - The highest peak value.
            - The index of that highest peak.
