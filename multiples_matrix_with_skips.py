    Challange 4: Multiplication Matrix with Skips
    Description: Youâ€™re given:
        1. A list of numbers
        2. A number to filter multiples (multiple_of)
        3. A number to skip multiples of (skip_multiple_of)

    EXAMPLE:
        INPUT:
            numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
            multiple_of = 2
            skip_multiple_of = 8
        OUTPUT: 
            [4, 12]
            []
            [12, 36]
'''

'''
    Okay : first get this [2,4,6]
        second multiply 2 * 2 = 4, 2 * 4 = 8, 2*6= 12 this should [4,12] -> only
