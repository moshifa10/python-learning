# CHALLANGE 8 

'''
    Challange 8: Student Performance Analyzer
    Goal: Work with nested data structures (lists + dicts) and perform data processing like a real-world system.
    Write a function called analyze_students(students: list) that:
    1. Accepts a list of student records
    2. Returns a dictionary with:
        "average_scores" â†’ a dictionary mapping each studentâ€™s name to their average score (rounded to 2 decimals).
        "top_student" â†’ the name of the student with the highest average.
        "failed_students" â†’ a list of student names whose average < 50.
        "overall_average" â†’ the average of all studentsâ€™ averages (rounded to 2 decimals).
    
    Examples: 
        INPUT:
            students = [
            {"name": "Alice", "scores": [80, 90, 70], "age": 20},
            {"name": "Bob", "scores": [45, 30, 55], "age": 19},
            {"name": "Charlie", "scores": [60, 75, 65], "age": 21},
            ]
        OUTPUT:
           {
            "average_scores": {"Alice": 80.0, "Bob": 43.33, "Charlie": 66.67},
            "top_student": "Alice",
            "failed_students": ["Bob"],
            "overall_average": 63.33
            } 

        ðŸ’¥ Bonus challenge (for max difficulty)
            Add a keyword argument passing_score=50 so the failure threshold can change dynamically:
